      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        I'm pretty new to the world of 3d art and animation. That being said I haven't exactly found a style for myself. My focus is to branch out,
        become proficient and to find a style that I enjoy and that you will enjoy. As of right now, I've been leaning towards photorealism with the watch,
        the Isometric room, and my godrays project.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Torus</b><br>
          This was just something that I was playing with that I though looked pretty neat, other than the sphere in the center, there are no rounded edges.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Isometric Rooms</b><br>
          If you google isometric rooms you'll find some really cool stuff and it's a really good way to play with style and form, I had some fun with the cartoon room as I stuck random objects and 
          ideas into the scene.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Pig</b><br>
          A simple practice project to mess with round objects as well as super simple sculpting practice. Also it made my sister happy.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Sunset</b><br>
          I really wanted to do a sunset. At first I wanted to do one over a field or behind a mountain but while I was playing with it I decided water looked really cool in this scene, the main goal
          was to get the perfect camera angle to catch a reflection path from the camera to the sun, in order to do this I had to animate the water and move my camera to get the perfect angle and shot.
          At one point I had the money shot and I accidentally started the animation again so the frame I was on moved then in my panic to fix it I accidentally moved the camera so I lost the spot, that 
          was sad..
          <p>
            <b>Watch</b><br>
            My first big project, I had almost finished when I realized that the orientation of the side buttons and mini-clocks were backwards and I had to restart which was heartbreaking. The 
            biggest downfall to doing this project is that I scoured the internet for reference images and now I get ads for watches everywhere.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Dark Room</b><br>
            I called this my godray project. The light rays coming through the window are called godrays. I saw a picture of a fence with light beams coming through and I had some cool ideas about 
            some eerie post-apocalyptic scenes. I suppose this is still a work in progress as it still needs a bit of work, but the whole scene was an experiment in lighting.
          </p>

        I'm not looking to do comissions right now, my repertoire is not yet advanced enough for me to feel confident seeking comissions. Though if you
        enjoy my work so far and want a comission done I'm 100% willing to work with you and see what you have in mind.
      </p>
      <p><b>Contact Me</b><br>
        If you are interested in comissions, you can email me, or you can reach me through Facebook or Instagram.

      <h3>Works In Progress</h3>
      <p>
        My works in progress, to show you what goes on behind the finished product and give you a progress map of what is currently being worked on.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Jet</b><br>
        The jet is a practice project to get better at modelling and making my models function well while looking good.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Mountainscape</b><br>
        I love landscapes and pretty views, the plan for this is to do a nice sunny mountain pasture and to do a sunset version as well behind one of the mountains.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Rose</b><br>
        I had a lot of fun with this one, right now I'm working on texturing the flower so it looks real and eventually I want to animate it so it blooms.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Tower</b><br>
        As a fantasy lover, a classic fantasy tower is required, I want to make this a super atmospheric scene so the focus isn't on the building as much as it's on the scene lighting and feel.

      <p>
        Hi, I'm Isaiah! I started learning 3d art about a month and a half ago, with my first project being a donut animation! I'm twenty two years old and the oldest of six children. 
        I can't really claim to be from any specific place as I've lived in Mississippi, Utah, Kansas, Ohio, Colorado, England, and now Idaho. I enjoy
        sci-fi and fantasy, David Weber, Robin Hobb, Brandon Sanderson, Issac Asimov, which is where much of my work will be pointed in the future!
