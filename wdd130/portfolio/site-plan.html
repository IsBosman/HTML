Follow the instructions on the activity in iLearn then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

        Content
      </h2>
      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Ease
        
        </b><br>
        I plan on people coming to my site because I want to show them my work without having to scroll through files and images on my phone or computer.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Style, Fit, and Preference</b><br>
        What I'd like someone to learn when they go onto the site is what I'm capable of, what my style is, and if I'm the right fit for what they want done. I also want people to see where I started and what I've learned. I'd like to have a page dedicated to me 
        revisiting my old work and making it better based on what I've learned. But the primary purpose for this is to let people see my work, and decide if they want a commission, if they simply want to view it,
        or if I'm not the right fit for them.
        </p>
        <p>
        <b>Commission Potential</b><br>
        Eventually I'd like to do comissions, it's not something that I'm ready for right now, but it's something that I look forward to doing in the future, one day I want to create something
        that makes waves in the community so I have a lot of time and a lot of energy that I still need to put into this.
      </p>
      <p><b>Contact Me</b><br>
        My website will be the only place that they'll be able to contact me if they want comissions done. It's also the only place they'll
        be able to see a full collection of my projects in one place, rather than scattered about in files or online.
      </p>

      <p>Images for the Home page</p>
        
        <img src="images/Spiral Torus - 1.jpg" alt="Spiral Torus" style="height: 500px;width: auto;">
        <img src="images/Low Poly Iso 01.jpg" alt="Low Poly Isometric Room" style="height: 500px;width: auto;">

        <img src="images/PostRoomGodRay.jpg" alt="God Rays" style="height: 500px;width: auto;">

      </ul>
      <h3>Works In Progress</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Progress and WIPs</b><br>
        At this point I want to show what I'm working on, what I've set aside for the time being, and show some of the behind the screen stuff that I'm working on. The stuff that hasn't been
        finished or rendered yet.
      </p>

      <p>Images for the Page 2</p>
        
        <img src="images/jetwip.png" alt="F22 Raptor WIP" style="height: 500px;width: auto;">

        <img src="images/towerwip.png" alt="Tower WIP" style="height: 500px;width: auto;">
        <img src="#" alt="image for Page 2">


      </ul>
      <h3>Bio</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Bio</b><br>
        At this point it would be redundant to have multiple pages for my portfolio unless I had multiple separate collections to show, which I do not. I will have this page be my bio for now,
        once I have some collections to be separated by the different pages then I can change things up.
      </p>
      <p>Images for the Page 3</p>
