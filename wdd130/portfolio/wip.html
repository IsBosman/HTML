            I've had an itch to do something sci-fi since I haven't done anything in that area yet and I thought doing a cool reactor type spaceship engine room would be fun, the goal is to have the ball
            in the center be a sun type thing with energy particle things being sucked into the machines on the top and bottom, so far I've got the meat of the scene I just need to add more details to 
            everything and then get to the texturing and compositing.

            <p style="font-size: larger;">
                I'm probably going to throw this one out, I started this project before I learned about having a clean model and this model is definitely not clean, so I'll update this when I have a prettier 
                jet to show.

            <p style="font-size: larger;">
                Landscapes and pretty views take up most of my camera roll, for this project I'm going for a calm meadow during the day, I'm also going to do a version with a sunset behind one of the mountains.

                I had a lot of fun with this one, right now I'm working on texturing the flower so it looks real and eventually I want to animate it so it blooms.

        <section>
            <img src="images/towerwip.png" alt="Tower" style="height: 500px; width: auto;">
            <p style="font-size: larger;">
                As a fantasy lover, a classic fantasy tower is required, I want to make this a super atmospheric scene so the focus isn't on the building as much as it's on the scene lighting and feel.
