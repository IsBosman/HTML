    <h1> About Me </h1>
    

    <h2>Isaiah Boswell,

        Zay, or Saiah
    </h2>

    <p> I'm in my third semester of BYUI and I'm studying Software Engineering!
        I love me a good book and I'm a big fan of Brandon Sanderson, although I think Isaac Asimov might take the cake as my favorite writer.
        I also love games in all their forms, whether it's sports, board games, tabletop games, video games, or card games, I love them all!
    </p>

    </h3>
    <p>I served my mission starting in the Arizona Scottsdale Mission, and eventually left to my original assignment,
        the England Birmingham Mission, which the split and I went to the England Bristol Mission.
