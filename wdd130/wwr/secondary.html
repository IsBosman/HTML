                San Juan River
            </h2>
            <p>
                The San Juan River offers world class Utah-Colorado river rafting and the adventure of a lifetime for all ages through one of the world’s greatest outdoor museums.
                 We offer daily 8-hour trips up to 10-day expeditions. The longer the trip the more opportunity there is for hiking to ancient Puebloan sites
                  to view rock art and cliff dwellings much like you’d see in Mesa Verde National Park. The San Juan river is divided into two different sections known as the Upper and Lower Canyon.
                   The Upper Canyon trip starts in Bluff and floats 27 miles to Mexican Hat. The Lower canyon begins at Mexican Hat and floats 58 miles to Clay Hills
                    crossing near the northern end of Lake Powell. We run river trips March – October.
